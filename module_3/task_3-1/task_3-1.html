      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When the wake-up time is exactly 7, the condition is met, and the output indicates catching the bus. If the wake-up time is anything else, nothing happens because there’s no alternative condition.</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>If the wake-up time is exactly 7, it indicates taking the bus. For any other time, it falls to the else clause, which defaults to taking the car. This covers all scenarios with a definitive output.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>If the wake-up time is less than 7 or greater than 8, neither the “bus” nor “train” conditions are met, so the program defaults to taking the car.</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>When the number is exactly zero, it isn’t classified as positive or negative, leading to the need for a special case for zero. Mathematically, zero is neither positive nor negative.</p>
